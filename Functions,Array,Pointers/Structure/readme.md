int sumArray(int a[], int n);

2️⃣ Count Even and Odd Numbers

Question:
Write a program that:

Reads n elements into an array

Uses a function to count how many numbers are even and odd

👉 Function prototype:

void countEvenOdd(int a[], int n);

🟡 Level 2 – Medium
3️⃣ Find Maximum and Minimum

Question:
Write a program that:

Stores 10 numbers in an array

Uses a function to find the maximum and minimum values

👉 Function prototype:

void findMaxMin(int a[], int n);

4️⃣ Reverse an Array

Question:
Write a program that:

Reads n elements in an array

Uses a function to reverse the array

Prints the reversed array using a loop

👉 Function prototype:

void reverseArray(int a[], int n);

5️⃣ Search an Element

Question:
Write a program that:

Takes an array of n elements

Uses a function to search for a given element

Returns its position if found, otherwise -1

👉 Function prototype:

int search(int a[], int n, int key);

🔵 Level 3 – Slightly Challenging
6️⃣ Count Frequency of Each Element

Question:
Write a program that:

Stores n integers in an array

Uses a function to print the frequency of each element

👉 Function prototype:

void frequency(int a[], int n);

7️⃣ Sort Array Using Function

Question:
Write a program that:

Reads n elements into an array

Uses a function to sort the array in ascending order

Displays the sorted array

👉 Function prototype:

void sortArray(int a[], int n);

🔴 Level 4 – Advanced (Exam/Interview Level)
8️⃣ Merge Two Arrays

Question:
Write a program that:

Reads two arrays

Uses a function to merge them into a third array

Prints the merged array

👉 Function prototype:

void mergeArray(int a[], int b[], int c[], int n1, int n2);

9️⃣ Check Palindrome Array

Question:
Write a program that:

Reads an array

Uses a function to check whether the array is a palindrome

👉 Function prototype:

int isPalindrome(int a[], int n);

🔟 Pass Array to Function and Modify It

Question:
Write a program that:

Stores numbers in an array

Uses a function to square each element of the array

Prints the modified array

👉 Function prototype:

void squareElements(int a[], int n);
